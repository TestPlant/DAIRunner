# DAIRunner

Currently there are 2 issues with the current release

Issue 1 if the result is error I still perform a call to get results and that causes an exception. The test does get executed so you can see the log file in DAI to see what the error is

Issue 2 No encrypted passwords are currently supported

both issues are being worked at
